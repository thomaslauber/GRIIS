# GRIIS
This is a standing version of the matched geometries of the GRIIS and PA-GRIIS datasets. This repository contains code to produce the geometries and a lookup table to match countryCodes with geometries. 

If you want to use any of the code, Google Earth Engine assets or the lookup table, please do not hesitate to contact me.
